      PUSKOM (Computer Center), previously named UKOM (Computer Unit). Established around 1982, based on the Rector's Decree, UKOM at that time was one of the technical units that provided computer training services, both for internal and external parties UNY.In its development, in 2004, UKOM changed its name to PUSKOM. Not only changing names, the types of services available are also increasing. In addition to continuing to provide computer training packages, a new service available is hotspot registration.<br><br>
      I was in the Computer Network and Telecommunications Division where at that time there was still much to see rather than work because it was still a vocational high school but was often invited by technicians to improve the network so that they could gain new knowledge in terms of experience on computer networks even if just watching.
